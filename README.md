# PUZZLE PUZZLE

![Title](Screenshots/Screenshot_1.png)

Developed for the February [Game Creator's Club] at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme is "Lights Out". 

## Game

![Game](Screenshots/Screenshot_2.png)

This game combines 3 of the most common puzzles - sliding blocks, pipemania and lights out.
They can all be mixed at will, and they can even have a rhythm game component on top, for good measure!

There are some hard-coded puzzles, but when they run out, the game just runs random puzzles.
Press 'R' to restart any puzzle, you can see the solution by pressing the '?' button
Press 'S' to skip a puzzle (cheat mode, this may be removed in the future, after the demo).
